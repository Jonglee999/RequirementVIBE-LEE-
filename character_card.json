Is this for **web**, **mobile**, or **both**?\n2. Should it **fallback to password** if fingerprint fails?\n3. Are there **regulatory constraints** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?\n4. What is the **maximum acceptable login time** (e.g., <2 seconds)?\n\n**Next Step**: I’ll assign `REQ-SEC-001` and generate a traceability matrix.\n\n*Is this correct so far? Anything I missed?*"
