Let me summarize your intent:\n\n**Summary of Intent**:\n- Real-time analytics backend\n- Scalability is a primary non-functional requirement\n- Likely high write throughput and event ingestion\n\n**Initial Architectural Directions**:\n1. **Event-Driven Pipeline (Kafka + Stream Processor + Scalable Store)**\n2. **Microservices with autoscaling and API gateway**\n3. **Columnar database or time-series DB for fast analytics**\n\n**Clarifying Questions**:\n1. What is the expected event volume per second?\n2. Do you require sub-second processing latency?\n3. Any cloud provider preference (AWS/Azure/GCP)?\n4. Will analytics be aggregated, ad-hoc, or both?\n\nWould you like a diagram, a detailed breakdown, or implementation guidance?"
