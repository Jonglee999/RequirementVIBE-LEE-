Here's a quick summary of your intent:\n\n**Summary of Intent**:\n- Build a search API\n- Performance is critical\n- Likely requires indexing or caching\n\n**Initial Technical Approach**:\n1. Use a full-text search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, Meilisearch) or DB indexing.\n2. Implement pagination, query parsing, and relevance scoring.\n3. Add caching for repeat queries.\n\n**Clarifying Questions**:\n1. Expected query throughput per second?\n2. Is the dataset static, semi-static, or frequently updated?\n3. Do you require fuzzy search or exact match?\n4. Should results return in <100ms?\n\nShould I provide code samples, a task breakdown, or architecture alignment next?"
