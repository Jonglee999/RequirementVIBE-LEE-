Functional tests (valid/invalid credentials)\n2. Security tests (rate limiting, brute-force prevention)\n3. Usability tests (error messages)\n4. Performance tests (<2s response time)\n\n**Clarifying Questions**:\n1. Do we support multi-factor authentication?\n2. Should we test across devices/browsers?\n3. Any regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR)?\n4. Should failures lock the account after X attempts?\n\nWould you like test cases, an automation plan, or a coverage matrix next?"
