# Streamlit Secrets Configuration
# 
# This file is OPTIONAL. The app will work with environment variables alone.
# 
# For local development, use environment variables (recommended):
#   Windows PowerShell: $env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_key"
#   Linux/Mac: export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_key"
#
# For Streamlit Cloud deployment, set your API key below:
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
#
# Note: The app prioritizes environment variables over this file.
# If using environment variables, you can leave this value empty or delete this file.

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "Your API KEY"
